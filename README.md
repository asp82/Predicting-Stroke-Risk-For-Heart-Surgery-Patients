## Predicting Stroke Risk for Heart Surgery Patients

Strokes are one of the most expensive health conditions from both a financial and human cost perspective. The mean lifetime cost of a stroke is $140,000 and strokes can be debilitating with effects lasting for the remainder of a patient's life. Every year, 15,000 heart surgery patients suffer from stroke complications.

Being able to predict stroke risk for heart surgery patients and take appropriate steps to mitigate and manage that risk is critical to improve patient outcomes and reduce healthcare costs. The Society of Thoracic Surgeons (STS) currently uses statistical models developed primarily in the 1990s to assess stroke risk for heart surgery patients. Our team used datasets provided by the STS for heart surgeries in Michigan from July 1, 2011 to December 30, 2016, to see if machine learning techniques could improve upon the current model.

Our methodology and results can be found in the paper available for download below. 

Abstract:

Strokes are one of the most costly health conditions from both a financial and human standpoint. The stroke incidence rate per capita is twice as high for individuals aged 50 and above that have had heart surgery than for those who have not. The Society of Thoracic Surgery publishes Adult Cardiac Surgery Risk Models that, among other things, predict stroke risk for heart surgery patients. These models are based on logistic regression techniques on preoperative features selected by a panel of physicians. We modeled stroke risk using a variety of machine learning techniques on an extensive set of preoperative features as well as a set that included both preoperative and postoperative features. No models outperformed STS when utilizing solely preoperative data. However, we found several models that outperformed the STS model, as measured by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (c-statistic), when postoperative data was incorporated. This suggests a rationale for the increased use of postoperative data to improve perioperative care to reduce strokes after heart surgery.
